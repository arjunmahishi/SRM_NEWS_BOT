# SRM_NEWS_BOT (A website crawler)

*Constantly mashing that refresh button to see if tomorrow's exam is cancelled or not*? Let this bot do it for you.
This bot crawles the college website, fetches updated News&Announcements and notifies subscribed users via E-mail. 

*Not interested in all the News/Announcements published on the website*?
Donâ€™t worry, using Google forms, we send updates to users about topics which they care about.

We are in the alpha test phase right now. It should be ready to roll in a week or two.
